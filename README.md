# testingreleases

Welcome to the most testable release of all time!

Here we intend to give you some explicit ways of testing releases via GitHub's release mechanism.

## Download!

You can download the
[latest version](https://github.com/cmconnelly/testingreleases/releases/latest/).


> Be sure you download **version 2.1 or later**!  Version 2.0
> inadvertently included an sentient AI bent on world domination.
> It has been disabled in later releases, but earlier releases
> could cause a anthropomorphic planetary extinction event if
> installed on powerful-enough hardware (e.g., a Commodore 64 or better).

> (We would remove the dangerous release, but for some reason,
GitHub's system won't let us.  Hmm....)
